# Tempest 2017-2018

This repository is for the code base for the 2017-2018 season. Be sure to ask the owner to add you as a collaborator so you can push changes.

Only push changes to the master branch after the team has agreed that the code works at an acceptable level. You should be able to pull the master branch for a tournament and experience no issues.

For development, be sure to make a branch for your assignment. That way, you can try out new stuff and break the code without affecting the master branch.
